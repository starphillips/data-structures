''' Exercise 8: Season from Month and Day

The year is divided into four seasons: spring, summer, fall and winter. While the exact dates
that the seasons change vary a little bit from year to year because of the way that the
calendar is constructed, we will use the following dates for this exercise:

Season - First day
Spring - March 20
Summer - June 21
Fall - September 22
Winter - December 21

Create a program that reads a month and day from the user. The user will enter the name of
the month as a string, followed by the day within the month as an integer. Then your
program should display the season associated with the date that was entered. '''
