''' Write a program that asks the user to enter the width and length of a room. Once the values have
been read, your program should compute and display the area of the room. The length and the
width will be entered as floating point numbers. Assume the values are in meters. '''

width = float(input("What is the width? "))
length = float(input("What is the length? "))


area = width * length

print(area)
